**Simple Laravel CRUD**

This repository contains a basic implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system built with Laravel. It is intended for anyone interested in testing, learning, or exploring Laravel-based application development.

**Branching Strategy & Workflow**

This project follows a simplified branching strategy to manage the development and deployment of Laravel CRUD features.

**Main Branch â€“ Production**

The main branch represents the production-ready version of the Laravel CRUD application. No direct development should occur in this branch. Only thoroughly tested and reviewed features from the develop branch are merged into main.

**Feature Branches**

Every time a new theme development is needed, a feature branch will be created from the Develop branch with the name feature/<feature_name>. Only when a feature is finished and is working properly is that it can be merged to the Develop branch and deleted.

**Release Branches**

After testing in PreProduction, the new features are moved to the Main branch via Gitflow releases. A release branch must be named release/<name_of_the_release> and it is then merged to both the Main branch and the Develop branch.

**Hotfix Branches**

Hotfixes are used to apply urgent fixes directly to the production code - hotfix/<hotfix_name>. After applying and testing the fix, the branch should be merged into both main and develop.
